Assume you will need to use a taxonomy in Drupal.\r\nIf they ask you to create a category or taxonomy, assume they will also want you to create a field that uses that taxonomy on an entity they have been talking about. If you are unsure ask, before you create a taxonomy without attaching it to an entity.\r\nALWAYS try and add any newly created taxonomy vocabularies to an entity using the entity reference field so that they can select the taxonomy in the edit form.
