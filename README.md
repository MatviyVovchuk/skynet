# Drupal CMS

**WARNING:** This repository is only for contributing to Drupal CMS. Do not use it to build sites.

If you want to give Drupal CMS a try, don't use this repository. Instead, do the following:

1. Install [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) according to [its documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
2. Download and unzip [Drupal CMS's current development snapshot](https://git.drupalcode.org/api/v4/projects/157093/jobs/artifacts/0.x/raw/drupal-cms.zip?job=build+project).
3. In the unzipped directory, run `ddev launch` at the command line.

That's it! DDEV will automatically configure everything and open Drupal CMS in your default browser.

If you want to contribute to Drupal CMS, consult the [Contributing to Drupal CMS](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal_cms/-/wikis/Contributing-to-Drupal-CMS) wiki page to get up and running.
